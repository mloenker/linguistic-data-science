**Stylometric Analysis of Fictional Character Dialogue**:
Research Question: How do the dialogue patterns of fictional characters in movies differ based on their gender and narrative role, and can these differences be measured using stylometric methods?

Hypothesis 1: Protagonists, who often serve as a neutral or normative narrative voice, will have a less distinctive "wordprint" than minor characters.

Hypothesis 2: The dialogue of female characters will be measurably more stylistically distinctive than that of male characters, as supported by existing research findings.

Umsetzung: Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus 

Lexical Diversity: Computing the Type-Token Ratio (TTR) to measure the richness of a character's vocabulary.

Word Frequency: Using TF-IDF to identify the words most distinctive to each character's voice.

Part-of-Speech Tagging: Analyzing the frequency of different parts of speech (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives) to understand stylistic habits.

Sentence and Word Length: Calculating the average sentence and word length


**How have the semantic meanings of cognitive and emotional terms evolved over time?**
1. Research Question
How have the semantic meanings of cognitive and emotional terms evolved over time?

Do these terms follow the established statistical laws of semantic change (Law of Conformity and Law of Innovation)?

2. Hypothesis
Hypothesis 1: The rate of semantic change for cognitive and emotional terms will be negatively correlated with their word frequency (Law of Conformity).

Hypothesis 2: The rate of semantic change for these terms will be positively correlated with their degree of polysemy (Law of Innovation).

Novel Hypothesis: The semantic trajectories of these abstract terms may diverge from general vocabulary, showing more significant shifts in response to major cultural, philosophical, or scientific developments.

3. Dataset
Source: HistWords project's pre-trained historical word embeddings.

Corpus: Derived from the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA).

Data: English embeddings spanning 150 years, pre-aligned across decades.

4. Methods
Term Curation: Select a list of 20-30 cognitive and emotional terms (e.g., reason, intuition, consciousness, anxiety, joy).

Semantic Change Calculation: For each term, compute the cosine distance between its vector embeddings in successive decades using a Python script.

Feature Extraction: Calculate word frequency and a measure of polysemy for each term from the corpus.

Statistical Analysis: Perform a statistical analysis (e.g., correlation, regression) to test the hypotheses by correlating the rate of semantic change with frequency and polysemy.

Visualization: Use libraries like matplotlib to plot the semantic change of key terms over time.
